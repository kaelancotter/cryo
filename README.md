This project is a collection of scripts for gathering file metadata and checksums / hashes prior to long term archival
(tape or similar "cold" storage) and storing the results in a database (mysql for now)

Early days for sure.  I might later build up a terminal and/or graphical UI, 
potentially support for distributed indexing working processes, support for postgres and sqlite, a webpage for browsing archives, etc.
Next steps will likely include some refactor for future work and building out tests.
